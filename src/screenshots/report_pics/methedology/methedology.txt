We have currently divided the course of our project into two architectures. One of them is used during the training process. The other is used for creating the applications

The ECG signals are acquired from the MIT-BIH database. WFDB tool provides various pre-processing functionalities. One of the important functions is QRS peak detection.The Python script uses flask server for classifier deployment. Matplotlib is used to plot the digital signal. The plots are converted to Numpy 'ndarrays'. OpenCV is used for reshaping the images. The models will be designed using Tensorflow library. Tensorflow provides functionality to create neural networks. It uses the standard backpropagation algorithm for training the network. Keras is another framework which provides high-level abstraction for implementing neural networks. Keras works on Tensorflow. There are various optimization algorithms available in Keras to calculate the loss function. These optimizers are variations of Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm. An important feature of Tensorflow is that it can use GPU for computation. GPU’s are preferred over CPU’s as they have multiple cores. They are considered to be 10 times faster than CPU’s.

MEAN stack architecture will be used to make the application. MEAN stack uses MongoDB as the database, ExpressJS as backend framework, Angular as FrontEnd framework and NodeJS as runtime environment. The frontend will consist of a form accept files and upload the digital signal (.dat and .hea format files). The details will be sent to the backend in JSON format. The signal is stored on disk and path of the signal is sent to Python Flask server for classification. The response from the Python script is sent to the backend and the backend will send the same to the frontend to display the result.
